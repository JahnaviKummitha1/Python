## Overview   
 
This repository contains code and resources for a data science project. The project utilizes various Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Libraries Used  
   
Below is a list of the primary Python libraries used in this project:
 1. Data Manipulation and Analysis
- **pandas**: Provides data structures and data analysis tools.
- **numpy**: Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
 
### 2. Data Visualization
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Based on matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **plotly**: A graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online.

### 3. Machine Learning
- **scikit-learn**: Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
- **tensorflow**: An open-source library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.
- **keras**: An open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks, capable of running on top of TensorFlow.

### 4. Data Preprocessing
- **scipy**: Provides utilities for scientific and technical computing, including modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, and others.
- **sklearn.preprocessing**: Submodule of scikit-learn that includes functions for scaling, centering, normalizing, and binarizing data.

### 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **nltk**: The Natural Language Toolkit, a library for working with human language data.
- **spacy**: An open-source library for advanced NLP in Python.

### 6. Deep Learning
- **pytorch**: An open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
- **fastai**: Simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices.

### 7. Data Handling
- **sqlalchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- **pymongo**: A Python driver for MongoDB.

### 8. Other Utilities
- **os**: A module providing a way of using operating system dependent functionality.
- **sys**: Provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
- **glob**: Finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, you can use the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('some numbers')
plt.show()
